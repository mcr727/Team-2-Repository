Topic: How the pandemic affected rideshare / public transport usage in NYC (03/01/2020 - present)

Summary: We will compare how the pandemic affected the transportation usage during March 2020 - August 2020 and compare it to the usage between March 2019 - August 2019. 

Data/sources we will explore to answer question: 
- City health data
	-Confirmed cases by region
	-Confirmed cases by age?
- Rideshare data (uber/lyft)
	-By region
- Public Transport data
- Citibike data 
- MTA Ridership data
	-Buses
	-Subway
	-Rail

<Optional>
- Tourism board

<Possible questions to consider>
Transportation usage at Phase one, two and so on or just show it on the graph and explain during the presentation like cases decreased during this month and so Phase one and then transportation usage? 
And also maybe skip cases by age?
